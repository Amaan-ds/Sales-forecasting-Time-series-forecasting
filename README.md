Sales forecasting is a critical aspect of business planning and strategy. Accurate sales predictions help companies manage inventory, optimize resource allocation, and make informed decisions. This repository demonstrates how to use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for sales forecasting, leveraging Python's powerful machine learning libraries.

Key Features:

Support Vector Machines (SVM): Utilizes SVM's powerful capabilities to handle non-linear relationships and high-dimensional spaces for accurate forecasting.
Feature Engineering: Includes techniques to select and transform features to improve model performance.
Performance Metrics: Provides comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess and fine-tune the model.
Visualization Tools: Offers visual tools to understand model predictions and improve interpretability.
